Create a basic calculator using React. Your app should have below mentioned functionality.

Add
Subtract
Multiply
Divide
Tasks:
Present all digits(0 to 9) and five symbols (*, %, +, -, =) and a display area (No need to write fancy CSS).

Allow all four operations to happen. A user should be able to use the last result with a variable "_" (underscore).

Allow the user to use both keyboard and onscreen fields.

For simplicity, you can clear the screen once the user presses a symbol.

Eg:

User presses 1123 (Display area shows 1123)

User presses * (Display area now only shows *)

User presses 0 (Display area now only shows 0)

User presses enter or = symbol (Display area now shows 0)

This complete one cycle.

In the next cycle user selects _ + 3 (Display area should now show 3)

In the next cycle user selects _ * 4 (Display area should now show 12)

Note: User need not focus on the display for the calculator to work. Eveything should work even without touching the mouse.
